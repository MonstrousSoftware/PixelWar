Bug list:

- AI doesn't know to send an airship back to a tower, if you can trick an airship to drop its bomb it becomes harmless.
- prevent the camera from going under the terrain


version 1.1 release notes
- added smoke effect and explosion effect
- fixed airship bug where it would move forever (because the distance to destination did not account for height).
- moved FPS display to lower right to be less intrusive
- fixed bug that 'commence battle' text appeared after resize
- camera transition when switching units
- camera shake when bomb is dropped
- prevent camera from going under terrain

version 1.2 release notes
- speed-up , esp. for Web GL version

version 1.3 release notes
- auto-aim now also considers height difference
- disable prev/next button in instructions screen when needed
- icons for buttons
- slopes at world edges
- proportional zoom
- improved tank model in Blender
- worked on letting the tank slope with the terrain. Works, although it is not perfect (issue with incorrect terrain normals)
