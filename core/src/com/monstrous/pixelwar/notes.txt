HTML version
------------
1- Generate distributable by ./gradlew html:dist from the terminal command line.
2- Remove the <a> tag from index.html under webapp and remove the refresh.jpg from html/build/dist/
3- zip the dist folder
4- upload, e.g. to itch.io.

Caveats: some browsers will refuse to play it if there is audio before the user has clicked anything.

The exit button in the menu has no effect in a browser. Should be disabled for HTML version.

Mobile browsers don't allow for a right click, which breaks the game play.


Add this to webapp/WEB_INF/index.html to prevent context menu in HTML version
    // prevent right click
    document.getElementById('embed-html').addEventListener('contextmenu', handleMouseDown, false);
